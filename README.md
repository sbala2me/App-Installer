**App Installer Script**

The App Installer Script is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to streamline the management of applications across multiple Linux distributions. It supports installation, uninstallation, and repository management for the following package managers:

1. **Apt** (Debian-based distros like Ubuntu, Linux Mint):
   - Install or remove applications using `apt-get` or `apt`.
   - Manage repositories by adding or removing PPAs with ease.

2. **DNF** (Fedora-based distros like Fedora, RHEL):
   - Install or remove applications using `dnf`.
   - Enable or disable repositories directly from the script.

3. **Pacman** (Arch-based distros like Arch Linux, Manjaro):
   - Install or remove packages using `pacman`.
   - Add or remove custom repositories by editing `pacman.conf` interactively.

4. **Flatpak** (Universal package manager):
   - Search for applications and install them with a simple command.
   - Manage Flatpak repositories like Flathub to add or remove sources.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Distro Support**: Works on major Linux distributions, ensuring compatibility regardless of your system.
